My [technical blog](https://lee-lindley.github.io) has articles on a mish-mash of topics, mostly on solving problems using Oracle tools.

My [current resume](https://github.com/lee-lindley/resume) is stored here on github.

Although the pinned projects below are the ones most likely to be of use, there are others you can find
in my repostory list which is reachable from a link above.

I try to make my documentation readme.md on each project be high quality. I don't always hit the mark of course, but I try. 
If you find one lacking, let me know. I care about it.

You are also welcome to contribute to any of these projects.
