My [technical blog](https://lee-lindley.github.io) has articles on a mish-mash of topics, mostly on solving problems using Oracle tools.

My [current resume](https://github.com/lee-lindley/resume) is stored here on github. 
I'm generally interested in new opportunities. I get satisfaction helping teams improve their application development techniques 
with Oracle, and also general improvement to the operation of a professional software development team. This includes
SDLC process, documentation writing, and helping partner organizations (business operations, QA, etc..) 
improve their operations and interaction with IT.

Although the pinned projects below are the ones most likely to be of use, there are others you can find
in my repostory list which is reachable from a link above. 

I try to make my documentation readme.md on each project high quality. I don't always hit the mark of course, but I try. 
If you find one lacking, let me know. I care about it.

You are also welcome to contribute to any of these projects. I'll consider any pull request, though you might want to 
enter an issue first to get my thoughts.
